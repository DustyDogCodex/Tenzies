    For example: A player can freeze 4 die that have the number 6 facing up, but the player cannot freeze 2 die with 6 facing up and another 2 die with the number 4 facing up. All frozen die must have the same number facing up. The player will then continue rolling the other die till all 10 die have the same number facing up.
